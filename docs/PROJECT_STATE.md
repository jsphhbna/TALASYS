# TALASYS Project State

## Current verified state — 15 October 2026

- **Working branch**: `main`
- **Audited baseline**: `cbd01f759b3ca12030e8250c81c4dcc520d17e70`
- **Status**: remaining media-claim, approval-eligibility, provisioning-fence, A07, A11, A12, A14, A16, and A18 repairs are implemented and locally verified; final commit/push is pending at the time of this checkpoint.
- **Verification**: unit 155/155; Auth/Firestore emulator 28/28 declared tests (exit 0); authenticated Chromium 24/24; both TypeScript checks pass; lint 0 errors/741 warnings; production build 48/48 pages; timezone suites 29/29 under UTC, Asia/Manila, and America/Los_Angeles.
- **Evidence boundary**: local emulators and controlled provider behavior only. No production deployment, rules publication, historical migration, live account/data change, or live Cloudinary asset mutation was performed.
- **Known qualification**: runtime warnings remain for typeless Node test modules, Firebase metadata lookup in the network-restricted environment, Next image LCP/scroll behavior, and Node's deprecated `module.register()`. These did not change exit status. A18 permission-denial/recovery is proven through the real Firestore adapter plus UI error-state tests; a live network outage was not induced.

The dated material below is historical and applies only to the revision and counts stated there.

- **Date**: 14 October 2026
- **Current Branch**: `main`
- **Head Commit**: `[Branch Head]`
- **Status**: **All 18 audit findings (A01–A18) repaired and verified locally; production/provider operations pending**

## 14 October audit remediation (A01–A18)

- **Group 1 (A04, A05, A10)**: Registration uploads use `talasys/proofs`; residents created in `"Pending"` lifecycle state; server-side account expiry issued upon authoritative approval; verification and admin notification creation runs atomically; admin notification types `['info', 'alert', 'registration', 'reactivation']` allowed in rules while client-authored notifications are blocked.
- **Group 2 (A01, A02, A03)**: Canonical verification owner (`residentId === userId === auth.uid`) enforced; media ownership validated via owner namespaces and server-controlled `mediaRegistry` (preventing client-writable reference spoofing); secure pre-registration claim route implemented (`POST /api/media/claim`); consistent authenticated delivery classification across all sensitive folders.
- **Group 3 (A06, A07, A17)**: Attempt-fenced admin account creation; blocked concurrent takeover; attempt-verified compensation preventing deletion of completed accounts; canonical request/payment state machine enforced preserving `paid`/`waived` invariants; payload-bound idempotency returning 409 on replay mismatch.
- **Group 4 (A08, A09)**: Reconciled email operations with unapplied `profileUpdates` transition to `reconciled` keeping remaining work resumable; caller-selected elapsed time removed as proof of stopped external writes; conservative recovery attestation enforced.
- **Group 5 (A11–A16, A18)**: Canonical audit log normalization with structured taxonomy, human-readable details, and fixed chart keys; document generator counts strictly track `hasGenerated === true`; inactive residents (`Locked`, `Deleted`, `Deleted by Resident`) excluded from active lists and selectors; official signatures resolved via `/api/media/view` with authorized delivery; Document Processing administrators authorized to generate signed documents; canonical `rejectionReason` rendered directly in resident tracker modal; explicit Asia/Manila date boundaries (`getManilaDayBounds`, `isTimestampToday`, `isTimestampThisWeek`) independent of host timezone; source readiness replacing timer heuristics.
