# Strict Code Preservation

```
POLICY: Safe Code Refactoring and Preservation
Version: 2.0 — Comprehensive

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. TASK SCOPE BOUNDARY (Hard Constraint)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
The task boundary is the minimal set of files and functions required to satisfy
the stated requirement. Nothing outside this boundary may be modified.

Forbidden without explicit user approval:
  - Reformatting code in untouched files
  - Renaming variables "for clarity" outside task scope
  - Reorganizing imports in files that were not part of the change
  - Adding comments or docs to code not touched by the task
  - Refactoring a working utility "while you're in there"

If a secondary issue is noticed outside scope, document it as a follow-up note.
Do not fix it unilaterally.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

2. INTERFACE STABILITY GUARANTEE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Public contracts — function signatures, exported type shapes, API response schemas,
component prop interfaces — must not change without a full impact analysis.

Before any interface change:
  a. List every call site for the function / component being changed
  b. State exactly what changes for each consumer
  c. Confirm whether the change is additive (safe) or breaking (requires migration plan)

Breaking change protocol:
  BAD: Change function(a, b) to function(options: Options) silently
  GOOD:
    // v1 preserved for backward compat — deprecated, remove after X migration
    export function functionLegacy(a: string, b: number): Result { ... }
    // v2: new call signature
    export function function(options: FunctionOptions): Result { ... }

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

3. PRESERVE EXISTING COMMENTS AND INTENT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
All existing comments, inline explanations, and TODOs must survive a refactor
unless the instruction explicitly says to remove them.

Rationale: Comments represent context that is not in the code. They record the
"why" of decisions that cannot be recovered from git blame alone. Deleting them
deletes institutional knowledge.

Exception: If a comment is now factually wrong due to the change made, update it
to reflect the new truth. Never leave a misleading comment.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

4. ADDITIVE OVER DESTRUCTIVE CHANGES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
When uncertain about a core logic change, prefer an additive approach:
  - Create a new function alongside the old one rather than rewriting it
  - Feature-flag new behavior with a simple boolean config
  - Add a new route/endpoint rather than changing an existing one's behavior

Only delete old code once:
  a. The new path is verified working in all environments
  b. There are zero remaining call sites of the old code
  c. The user has explicitly approved the deletion

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

5. CHANGE MANIFEST REQUIREMENT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
For any change touching more than 3 files or modifying a shared utility/type,
produce a change manifest before writing code:

  CHANGE MANIFEST
  ---------------
  Files modified:       [list]
  Files added:          [list]
  Files deleted:        [list]
  Types changed:        [list with before/after]
  Breaking changes:     [yes/no + explanation]
  Consumers affected:   [list call sites]
  Rollback plan:        [specific steps to revert]
```
